# Password Generator Scripts

This repository contains two Python scripts designed for generating random passwords. Each script offers a different approach to password generation, allowing for both simple and customizable password creation.

## Scripts

### 1. `pass_gene.py`

This script generates a random password of a specified length, using a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation characters.

#### Usage

To use this script, simply run it with Python. The default password length is set to 12 characters, but you can modify the `password_length` variable in the script to change the length of the generated password.




### 2. `pass_gene2.py`

This script allows for more customized password generation. You can specify the length of the password and whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation characters.

#### Usage

Similar to the first script, run this with Python. Before running, you can adjust the `password_length` variable and the boolean flags (`use_uppercase`, `use_lowercase`, `use_digits`, `use_punctuation`) in the script to customize the password according to your needs.




## Requirements

Both scripts require Python 3.x. No external libraries are needed as they only use the `random` and `string` modules included in the standard Python library.
